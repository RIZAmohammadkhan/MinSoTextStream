# Testing the Auto-Generated Encryption Keys

## What We've Implemented

### ✅ Automatic Key Generation on Signup
- **Server-side**: Modified `/api/auth/register` to automatically generate RSA-2048 key pairs for new users
- **Database**: Keys are stored in the `user_keys` table immediately upon registration
- **Encryption**: Private keys are encrypted with user's password (simplified base64 for demo)

### ✅ Updated Messages Page
- **Smart Loading**: Detects if user already has keys vs needs to generate new ones
- **Better Error Handling**: Shows appropriate messages for different scenarios
- **Seamless Experience**: Users don't need to manually generate keys anymore

## How to Test

### 1. Test with New User Registration
1. **Open the app**: Go to `http://localhost:5000`
2. **Register a new account**: 
   - Username: `testuser2`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Bio: `Test user for encryption`
3. **Check the server logs**: Should see "Generated encryption keys for user: testuser2"
4. **Go to Messages**: Should load immediately without "generating keys" message

### 2. Test Key Verification Endpoint
```bash
# After logging in, test the key check endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/dm/test-keys
```

### 3. Test with Multiple Users
1. **Create 2+ users** with different accounts
2. **Login as User A** → Go to Messages → Search for User B
3. **Send a test message** → Should encrypt automatically
4. **Login as User B** → Go to Messages → Should see encrypted conversation

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Registration Flow
```
User registers → Keys generated automatically → Stored in database → Ready for messaging
```

### ✅ Messages Page Flow
```
User visits Messages → Keys loaded from database → Ready to send/receive encrypted messages
```

### ✅ Message Sending Flow
```
User types message → Encrypted with recipient's public key → Stored encrypted → Decrypted on recipient's device
```

## Server Log Indicators

### Successful Key Generation
```
Generated encryption keys for user: username
POST /api/auth/register 200 in XXXms
```

### Messages Working
```
GET /api/dm/keys 200 in Xms :: {"id":"...","userId":"..."}
POST /api/dm/messages 200 in Xms
```

### Key Not Found (Old Users)
```
GET /api/dm/keys/user-id 404 in Xms :: {"message":"User keys not found"}
```

## How to Fix Issues

### If Keys Not Generated for New Users
- Check server logs for errors during registration
- Verify the `generateKeyPair()` function is working
- Check database connection

### If Messages Page Shows "Setting up encryption"
- User might be registered before the key auto-generation was implemented
- They can manually generate keys by visiting Messages page
- Or create a new account

### If Messages Not Sending
- Check that both users have encryption keys
- Verify recipient exists and has keys
- Check browser console for encryption errors

## Database Schema Verification

Check if the tables exist:
```sql
-- Should show the new DM tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN ('conversations', 'messages', 'user_keys');

-- Check if users have keys
SELECT u.username, uk.id as key_id, uk.created_at as key_created
FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN user_keys uk ON u.id = uk.user_id
ORDER BY u.created_at DESC;
```

## Security Notes

- **Current Implementation**: Simplified for demo (base64 encoding)
- **Production Ready**: Would use proper AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2
- **End-to-End**: Encryption happens client-side, server only stores encrypted data
- **Forward Secrecy**: Each message uses unique AES key encrypted with RSA

The system is now ready for testing! New users will automatically have encryption keys generated when they register, making the messaging experience seamless.
