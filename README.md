## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The project is structured as a monorepo with a clear separation of concerns:

-   **`client/`**: A modern React Single-Page Application (SPA) built with Vite. It handles all UI rendering and communicates with the backend via a REST API and a WebSocket connection.
-   **`server/`**: An Express.js REST API server that manages business logic, authentication, and database interactions. It also hosts the WebSocket server for real-time communication.
-   **`shared/`**: Contains code shared between the client and server, primarily the Drizzle ORM schema and utility functions. This ensures type consistency across the entire application.
-   **`migrations/`**: Drizzle-generated SQL migration files for version-controlling the database schema.

## üöÄ Getting Started

You can run this project locally using either Docker (recommended for ease of setup) or by setting up the services manually.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and Docker Compose

### 1. Using Docker (Recommended)

This is the quickest way to get the entire application stack‚Äîincluding the database‚Äîup and running.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MinSoTextStream.git
    cd MinSoTextStream
    ```

2.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    The project is pre-configured for Docker. No `.env` file is needed for the default Docker setup.

3.  **Build and Start the Services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    This command will:
    -   Build the `app` Docker image.
    -   Start the PostgreSQL database service.
    -   Start the application service.
    -   Run database migrations automatically on startup.

4.  **Access the Application:**
    -   The application will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
    -   The PostgreSQL database will be exposed on port `5432`.

5.  **Stopping the Services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

### 2. Manual Local Setup (Without Docker)

If you prefer to run the services on your host machine without Docker.

1.  **Clone and Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MinSoTextStream.git
    cd MinSoTextStream
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set up PostgreSQL:**
    -   Install PostgreSQL locally or use a cloud provider.
    -   Create a database (e.g., `minsotext`).

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    -   Copy the example `.env` file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    -   Edit the `.env` file with your database connection string and a secure JWT secret:
        ```dotenv
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:123456@localhost:5432/minsotext"
        JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key"
        ```

4.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    ```bash
    npm run db:migrate
    ```

5.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## üìú Available Scripts

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with hot-reloading.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the client and server for production.
-   `npm run start`: Runs the production-ready build.
-   `npm run db:generate`: Generates a new SQL migration file based on schema changes.
-   `npm run db:migrate`: Applies pending migrations to the database.
-   `npm run db:studio`: Opens the Drizzle Studio GUI to interact with your database.
