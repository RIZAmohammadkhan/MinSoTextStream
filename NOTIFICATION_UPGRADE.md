# 🔔 Notification System Upgrade

## What Was Replaced

The old toast system using:
- `@radix-ui/react-toast` 
- Custom `useToast` hook
- Manual toast state management
- Limited styling options

## What's New: Sonner Notifications

**Sonner** is a modern, lightweight, and beautiful toast notification library that provides:

### ✨ Key Improvements

1. **Better UX**
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Smart positioning (auto-adjusts based on screen size)
   - Expandable notifications for longer content
   - Rich colors and modern styling

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - **Promise-based notifications**: Automatically update loading → success/error
   - **Action buttons**: Interactive notifications with custom actions
   - **Auto-dismiss**: Smart timing based on notification type
   - **Multiple variants**: success, error, warning, info, loading

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Simpler API with intuitive method names
   - Better TypeScript support
   - Smaller bundle size
   - Less configuration needed

### 🎯 Usage Examples

```typescript
import { notifications } from "@/lib/notifications";

// Simple notifications
notifications.success("Success!", "Operation completed");
notifications.error("Error", "Something went wrong");
notifications.warning("Warning", "Please check your input");
notifications.info("Info", "Helpful information");

// Loading with auto-update
const loadingToast = notifications.loading("Processing...");
// Auto-dismisses when resolved

// Promise-based (handles loading → success/error automatically)
notifications.promise(apiCall(), {
  loading: "Saving...",
  success: "Saved successfully!",
  error: "Failed to save"
});

// Interactive notifications with actions
notifications.action("File deleted", {
  label: "Undo",
  onClick: () => restoreFile(),
  description: "You can undo this action"
});
```

### 📁 Files Updated

✅ **Core System**
- `App.tsx` - Updated to use Sonner Toaster
- `lib/notifications.ts` - New centralized notification system

✅ **Components Migrated**

- `pages/notifications.tsx`
- `components/compose-post.tsx`
- `components/comment-section.tsx`
- `components/post-card.tsx`
- `components/settings-dialog.tsx`

### 🧹 Cleanup Opportunities

You can now safely remove these old files:
- `hooks/use-toast.ts`
- `components/ui/toast.tsx`
- `components/ui/toaster.tsx`

And remove this dependency:
```bash
npm uninstall @radix-ui/react-toast
```

### 🎨 Customization

The Sonner toaster is configured with:
- Dark theme to match your app

You can further customize in `App.tsx` by modifying the `Toaster` component props.

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. Test all notification scenarios in your app
2. Remove old toast files once confirmed working
3. Consider adding more interactive notifications with actions
4. Customize notification timing for different use cases

The new system provides a much more modern, user-friendly notification experience! 🎉
